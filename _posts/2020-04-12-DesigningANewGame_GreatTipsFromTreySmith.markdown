## Introduction

This list is based on top 10 ideas to come up with game design ideas, according to Trey Smith [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0c1a-MSg_o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0c1a-MSg_o)

Most games are refined versions of previous ideas. So in this post we're taking an approach that it's about finding an idea that:
* you have resources to complete,
* is popular,
* has a niche that is currently popular or gaining traction.

That way you can not only easier create a game (because most of the designes will have a base), but also can potentially be similarily or more popular.

## The list

*Please be aware, when going through this list it very easy to forget that you have to look for game design ideas instead of playing them :)*

### 5 Already created best Game Jam games
Find as much as possible different game jam games that have interesting gameplay or graphics style. Focus on what makes a game unique and original. Don't try to nit pick imperfections. Be above it.

### 3 Steam most popular
This is another platform that can give an idea what is popular now and what sells good aside from giving you an inspiration.
Navigate to indie games, go to top sellers.

### 2 Checkout and play new games regularly
Having a good everyday knowledge of what is there is best for knowing trends and having ideas. Every week download new top games from google play / app store.

- how to look:
	- Look for Top games, Top Selling games [https://play.google.com/store/apps/top/category/GAME](https://play.google.com/store/apps/top/category/GAME)
	- Checkout weekly 'what have you been playing' and 'quick android game reviews' [https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/) 

### 1. Participate in game jams
This way you will not only know your own possibilities, but also have ideas by your own. This is especially good, because a game jam is actually the easiest way to create a prototype / game in your free time. You can research a new game idea and if you are an indie game developer that means that you make games in your free time, so a game jam really is your best bet to check if a prototype will be fun.

How to apply for a game jam:
- online
	- on itch.io there are multiple game jams just, browse to 'jams' and checkout the calendar for what you like most [https://itch.io/jams](https://itch.io/jams)
	- [https://ldjam.com/](https://ldjam.com/) is the most popular game jam. It happes every three months, so check the site out and add the next ludum to your calendar.
- in person
	- Nordic Game Jam in Kopenhagen is the biggest game jam on the planet.
	- Checkout different game jams in your area, this could be an arduous sometimes, but your best bet is that every year around january there will be a Global Game Jam site near your location. [https://globalgamejam.org/](https://globalgamejam.org/)


## After word

It takes time and energy to fully investigate game ideas, but if you want to properly approach to a topic, you have to put some effort into it, not only just play your favourite game another year :)
