This post is a wishlist what I want to be able to do in the game. So here there are listed actions, statistics and items. Very raw design.

I still need to put all those things from underneath into the graphical design.

## Views
- car view
	- actions in the car: 
	> > ![](/assets/designing_a_game/actions_car.png)
		- cover up windows
		- hide under blanket
		- go into sleeping bag
		- try to fall asleep
- neighbourhood view
	- walk to:
		- shop
		- gas station
		- a dark street and wait for a person
	- drive to
		- gas station
		- residential area
		- industrial area
	- high perception
		- the shop clerk just went to the toilet. quickly run (speed) and steal money from the cash register (manual coordination)
		- one of the car is unlocked, open and search it (speed, perception)
		- there's one drunk man who passed out on the street (strength)
- city view (a map with clickable cities, forests, roads, casinos)


## Viago stats
- primary
	- perception
	- speed
	- coordination
	- strength
- secondary

## Car stats

## Situations
