In previous post I have written down how I have prepared to design this one, but let's recap.

I want to continue working on my game jam prototype: Viago the Vampire:

I have selected one mobile game that I want to base on: Out There:

![](/assets/designing_a_game/Out-There-1.jpg)

### Premise for Viago The Vampire

- It has to be
	- Story based,
	- Have a proper mood,
	- Gameplay has to supplement the the story and mood.


### Idea 1: A vampire roadtrip

Most of the time it will be managing your own car.

The car is split into blocks in which you can place things (exactly like Out There).
- You could put a sleeping bag, 
- kitchen stove (for a vampire?), 
- yoga mat, 
- glass jars with blood for later,
- knife. 

You will sleep, eat and rest in the car. It has to contain all necessesities for a vampire to live there. 

Occasionally the vampire will have to go out hunting or shopping. 

The vampire will have many attributes to help with living in the car, earning money, surviving in cities, on roadsides and to defend himself.

Purpose of the game: to reach your beloved one and give a letter to her. 

The game has three main views (you can switch between them at any time:


- Car view
 > ![](/assets/designing_a_game/car_view.jpg)
	- you can use and rearrange your items in the car here
	- you see your cars stats and can refuel, redrink, powerup using items from the cars slots
- Neighbourhood view
> ![](/assets/designing_a_game/neighbourhood_view.jpg)
	- you can select where to drive exactly and do all those actions
		- gas station
			- fuel up
			- feed on the cashier
			- steal
		- neighbourhood
			- spend the night
			- steal a car
			- break into a house 
			- feed on inhabitants
		- a parking in the park
			- spend the night
		- and many more custom neighbourhoods with custom actions, all of those depend on your items and skills
- National view
> ![](/assets/designing_a_game/national_view.jpg)
	- here you select where to drive next
		> be cautios, because you have to make sure you have enough fuel and blood to drive to a destination
